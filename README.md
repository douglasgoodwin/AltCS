# Welcome!

#### This is _Alternative Computer Science_, aka **MS 059 SC.** As the name suggests, the idea behind this class is to provide an alternative approach to learning Computer Science. We will proceed by making analog things \(some of which compute in some way\), identifying the information contained or generated by these things, and them translating them into Python code.

### Description

Fifty years ago all computers were analog: they found answers by reading changes in a physical model to describe a problem. The course will introduce students to analog computation by solving problems best done with non-digital techniques. We will cover the history of traditional topics in computer science by showing how they emerged from analog computation. We will then map the analogs to algorithms and write code to reproduce the original solutions.

      <td style="text-align:left">Most Computer Science courses jump into applications of symbolic manipulation
        without considering the history and development of these abstractions.
        This course is designed to introduce the student to computers, programming,
        and some of the key ideas on which the field of computer science is based.
        This introduction is completed in three parts: through readings, lectures,
        physical labs, and coding.</td>

        <p>There are other Introductory Computer Science classes offered in the 5Cs.
          However this one studies the historical and conceptual backdrop of computation
          and students will see how analog computation was replaced by algorithms
          and then implemented in hardware and software.</p>
