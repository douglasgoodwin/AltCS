# ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS

Scripps students seeking to register to receive academic accommodations must contact Academic Resources and Services \(ARS\) at [ars@scrippscollege.edu](mailto:ars@scrippscollege.edu) to formalize accommodations. Students will be required to submit documentation and meet with a staff member before being approved for accommodations. Once ARS has authorized academic accommodations, a formal notification will be sent out.

A student’s home campus is responsible for establishing and providing accommodations. If you are not a Scripps student, you must contact your home institution to establish accommodations. Below is a list of coordinators on the other campuses:

**CMC** - Julia Easley, [julia.easley@claremontmckenna.edu](mailto:julia.easley@claremontmckenna.edu)\*\*\*\*

**Harvey Mudd** – Deborah Kahn, [dkahn@hmc.edu](mailto:dkahn@hmc.edu)
