# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Students are expected to abide by the Scripps College academic integrity code. You must submit work that is your own and which is original work for this class. Also, all sources must be documented. Omission of sources is considered plagiarism, even if it is an oversight and/or unintentional. All plagiarism will be reported to the department and Deanâ€™s office for further action.
