| 9/13 | Reports | Lecture Report ONE: EARLY COMPUTATION |
| 9/16 | Reading | AP CH3: Draw |
| 9/16 | Activity | AP CH3 Draw |
| 9/18 | Activity | **CODE**: Tell the computer how to reproduce your drawing. Just as you told your partner where to draw the lines, tell the turtle where to draw lines to reproduce your drawing. |
| 9/18 | Assignment | **ANALOG**: Draw something in the room with several lines. Then encode your drawing as a set of instructions. Read these instructions to the class. Repeat these instructions until your partner reproduces your drawing. |
| 9/19 | Assignment | TP EX4: Do the turtle assignment in Processing.py |
| 9/22 | **LABEL** | **SELECTION \(AND SORTING\)** |
| 9/23 | Reading | TP CH3: Functions, parameters & Arguments |
| 9/23 | Activity | JV 4: Python Semantics: Variables |
| 9/25 | Activity | **ANALOG**: Identify several points in the classroom, let’s call them “cities.” Make sure that you place some of these points on the floor, on tables, and chairs. Connect these points with string or rope, knotting the string and labeling each point that the strings cross. I will choose two cities: use the string to calculate the shortest path between them. |
| 9/30 | Reading | DEWDNEY CH33 |
| 9/30 | Activity | JV 5: Python Semantics: Operators |
| 10/2 | Activity | **CODE**: Use selection to find the shortest path with Python. Measure the length of string\(the “edge”\)between each city\(“node”\) and record these entries in a data structure. |
| 10/6 | **LABEL** | **RECURSION** |
| 10/7 | Reading | TP CH5 Conditionals and Recursion |

| 10/9 | Activity | **ANALOG**: Find a recursive method to reproduce this double-spiral pattern. Record your method. |
| 10/11 | Reports | Lecture Report TWO: L-SYSTEMS |
| 10/14 | Activity | JV 7: Built-in Data Structures |
| 10/16 | Activity | **CODE**: design a recursive program to generate spiral patterns with Processing.py. |
| 10/20 | **LABEL** | **ITERATION** |
| 10/21 | **LABEL** | **FALL BREAK** |
| 10/23 | Reading | TP CH7 Iteration |
