# Exercise 4

### Exercise 4A

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: You won't be able to draw turtle graphics on Google Colab!
{% endhint %}

_Download the code in this chapter from_ [_http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py_](http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py)_._

1. _Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program while executing circle\(bob, radius\). You can do the arithmetic by hand or add print statements to the code._
2. _The version of arc in Section_ [_4.7_](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2005.html#refactoring) _is not very accurate because the linear approximation of the circle is always outside the true circle. As a result, the Turtle ends up a few pixels away from the correct destination. My solution shows a way to reduce the effect of this error. Read the code and see if it makes sense to you. If you draw a diagram, you might see how it works._

### Exercise 4B

_Write an appropriately general set of functions that can draw flowers as in Figure_ [_4.1_](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2005.html#fig.flowers)_._

_Solution:_ [_http://thinkpython2.com/code/flower.py_](http://thinkpython2.com/code/flower.py)_, also requires_ [_http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py_](http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py)_._

### Exercise 4C

_Write an appropriately general set of functions that can draw shapes as in Figure_ [_4.2_](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2005.html#fig.pies)_._

### Exercise 4_D_

_The letters of the alphabet can be constructed from a moderate number of basic elements, like vertical and horizontal lines and a few curves. Design an alphabet that can be drawn with a minimal number of basic elements and then write functions that draw the letters._

_You should write one function for each letter, with names `draw_a`, `draw_b`, etc., and put your functions in a file named letters.py. You can download a “turtle typewriter” from_ [_http://thinkpython2.com/code/typewriter.py_](http://thinkpython2.com/code/typewriter.py) _to help you test your code._

_You can get a solution from_ [_http://thinkpython2.com/code/letters.py_](http://thinkpython2.com/code/letters.py)_; it also requires_[_http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py_](http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py)_._Exercise 5  

_Read about spirals at_ [_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral)_; then write a program that draws an Archimedian spiral \(or one of the other kinds\)._
