# Exercise 2

### **Exercise 2A**

Repeating my advice from the previous chapter, whenever you learn a new feature, you should try it out in interactive mode and make errors on purpose to see what goes wrong.

* We’ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?
* How about x = y = 1?
* In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?
* What if you put a period at the end of a statement?
* In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: x y. What happens if you try that in Python?

### **Exercise 2B**

Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator: 

1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 π r3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace \(8:15 per mile\), then 3 miles at tempo \(7:12 per mile\) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
