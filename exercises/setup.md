### Setting up your homework drive <a id="11a4"></a>

1. Login to your Google Drive
2. Create a folder called AltCS for your Jupyter notebooks
3. 4. 
**Create a folder for your notebooks**

\(Technically speaking, this step isn’t totally necessary if you want to just start working in Colab. However, since Colab is working off of your drive, it’s not a bad idea to specify the folder where you want to work. You can do that by going to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and clicking “New” and then creating a new folder. I only mention this because my Google Drive is embarrassingly littered with what looks like a million scattered Colab notebooks and now I’m going to have to deal with that.\)
