# RECURSION: Natural Patterns

**Recursion** defines a structure defined as operations on all or a part of itself. This elegant procedure generates many complex patterns in nature. For example: sunflower seeds are packed into the head of the flower in what appears to be two oppositely directed spirals. Pinecones follow the same pattern. This crisscrossing spiral arrangement is called **Phyllotaxis**, and **Phyllotactic spirals** form a distinctive class of natural patterns.
