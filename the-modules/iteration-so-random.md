# ITERATION: So Random

## Lecture & Analog Lab

In algorithmic situations, recursion and iteration can give the same results. However, recursion can be employed as a solution without knowing how many times the action will have to repeat. You will need to determine the number of loops in an iteration.

**Randomness** has a spectrum. Let’s consider ways to generate randomness by analog and digital means.

## Instruction

Deterministic machines cannot produce randomness, but we may approximate randomness\(pseudorandomness\)with various **iterative**techniques. Let’s discuss the Middle Square Method and ways to evaluate how random its results are. 

## Code Lab

Let’s represent these **switches in Python code**and patch them together to build larger operations.
