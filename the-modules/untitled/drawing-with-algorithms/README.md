# Drawing with Algorithms

Encode the appearance of something you know well with simple shapes: dots, lines, rectangles, and ellipses. Do this with text in a way that could be replicated by someone with pen/cil and paper.

### Example:

1. Draw a large circle.
2. draw a small circle inside the first in the top left-hand quadrant
3. fill the small circle
4. draw a third circle to mirror the second one in the top right-hand quadrant
5. fill this circle
6. draw an arc within the bottom half of the large circle that follows the bottom of the large circle. This arc should be bilaterally symmetrical.
