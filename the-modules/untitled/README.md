# SEQUENCE: Draw with Lines

S**equence matters!** Programs specify the order of execution, and this ordering makes the difference between failure and success. Imagine a cake with the sequence of instruction out of order, it might look like an old shoe with some eggs cracked on top.

## Analog Lab

**Draw** something in the room with several lines. Then encode your drawing as a set of instructions. Read these instructions to your partner. Repeat these instructions until your partner reproduces your drawing.

## Instruction

Drawing things with Python can be hard because you need to go outside the core language to draw anything. Here are a few popular choices.

1. **Python Turtle graphics** depends on \[Tk\]\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk\_\(software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_%28software)\)\) 

2. We use [Matplotlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib) for data science. It's not the prettiest solution, but it does provide a convenient interface for data-capable libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and Numpy. [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vwvudlTCzGcNj6iz_mUZso1ZEUN0U4oI) supports Matplotlib.

3. [Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/) expects you to render code in a special environment. It's worthwhile because you are given the strongest drawing tools imaginable in exchange for this inconvenience.

## Code Lab

**Tell the computer how to reproduce your drawing.** Just as you told your partner where to draw the lines, tell the turtle where to draw lines to reproduce your drawing.
