# SEQUENCE: Draw with Lines

S**equence matters!** Programs specify the order of execution, and this ordering makes the difference between failure and success. Imagine a cake with the sequence of instruction out of order, it might look like an old shoe with some eggs cracked on top. 

## Analog Lab

**Draw** something in the room with several lines. Then encode your drawing as a set of instructions. Read these instructions to your partner. Repeat these instructions until your partner reproduces your drawing.

## Instruction

**Turtle graphics.** 

## Code Lab

**Tell the computer how to reproduce your drawing.** Just as you told your partner where to draw the lines, tell the turtle where to draw lines to reproduce your drawing.
