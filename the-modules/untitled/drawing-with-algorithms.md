# Drawing with Algorithms

Encode the appearance of something you know well with simple shapes: dots, lines, rectangles, and ellipses. Do this with text in a way that could be replicated by someone with pen/cil and paper.

### Example:

1. Draw a large circle.
2. draw a small circle inside the first in the top left-hand quadrant
3. fill the small circle
4. draw a third circle to mirror the second one in the top right-hand quadrant
5. fill this circle
6. draw an arc within the bottom half of the large circle that follows the bottom of the large circle. This arc should be bilaterally symmetrical.

### Student examples

**Wang, Pu-Sheng**

1. Draw a circle with the diameter of 8mm.
2. Draw another 8mm circle immediately to the right of the last one
3. Repeat step 2. until 7 circles line up in a row
4. In the middle above the first and the second circle, draw another same-sized circle tangent with the first and the second ones
5. In the middle above the second the the third circle, draw another same-sized circle tangent with the second and the third ones
6. Repeat step 4 and 5. until 6 circles line up in a row directly above the first row
7. Above the second row, draw another row of 7 circles that’s mirrored with the first row by the second-row.
8. There should be 20 same-sized circles all tangent with the adjacent others.
9. This is a top view of the object\(s\) in 1 to 1 scale.

**Stastny, Mia C.**

1. draw one vertical line
2. draw one horizontal line intersecting with the other, like a cross
3. move one space to the right
4. draw one vertical line
5. draw an arc beginning at the bottom right of the aforementioned vertical line, which goes up about halfway on the line and ends one space to the right, parallel with the beginning point
6. move one space to the right
7. draw a horseshoe shape with the open part facing to the right
8. draw a line that bisects this shape laterally, connecting the leftmost part of the curve to the end of the line on the right side
9. move one space to the right and repeat the former shape
10. draw a vertical line about half the size of the ones you have drawn previously, and draw another arc beginning from the bottom of the line, reaching the same height as the vertical line, and then coming down where the line began, but one space to the right.
11. draw a horseshoe shape with the open part facing the right side
12. draw a vertical line touching the right side of the shape that closes it and extends up about the same length as the curve

On a piece of paper, or whatever blank surface you prefer, draw an equilateral triangle in black ink, with the point facing down and the base up. Make sure the three connecting lines of the triangle \(that make up the sides\) have a consistent weight - not too wide/thick, but enough to make it apparent. Then, about 3/4ths of the way down the triangle, draw a line the same weight as it’s surrounding counterparts across from one side to the other, parallel to the base. Make sure said line only protrudes fractionally on both sides of the triangle at an equal distance. Think symmetry.

**Yazloff, Kayla R.**

1. Draw a rectangle that is longer vertically than it is horizontally 

2. On the bottom of the previous rectangle, draw a horizontal rectangle who's horizontal length is just longer than the width of the previous horizontal rectangle. 

3. Do the same thing, but on the bottom of the horizontal rectangle, making sure the new rectangle's horizontal length is slightly longer.

4. On the top of the vertical rectangle \(the first one you drew\), do the same thing you did in the second step \(draw a horizontal rectangle who's horizontal length is just longer than the width of the vertical rectangle\)

5. From either side of the top of the previous rectangle, make two long horizontal lines going upwards

6. At the top of these two parallel lines, connect them with a curve 

Use the force, fellow Jedi! 

**Grandjean, Ian**

1. Draw a wide rectangle.
2. Within the first rectangle, draw an additional one \(half the original height\) and place it in the bottom half.
3. Within the second rectangle draw 29 vertical lines, evenly spaced.
4. Measure those vertical lines in half, and make a small placement mark in each vertical line’s center, in the following order
5. Mark two consecutive lines, skip one line, mark three consecutive lines, skip one line, repeat in this order until compete.
6. On the marked lines, make the line thicker in the upper half only. Make sure all thick marks are even, and do not extend beyond the lines in any direction.

**Zhao, Shuhui**

1. There is a rectangle with all the four corners curved
2. Within the rectangle, there is a smaller rectangle with four 90 degree corners.The left and right sides are narrow, upside and bottom are three times wider than left and right side.
3. Because of the two rectangles, we get a blank box.
4. Within the upside blank box, there is a circle on the left side and an ellipse right beside it.
5. There are two small circles above the ellipse.
6. Within the bottom blank box, there is one large circle at the center of this blank area.  Now, make the rectangle that we first drew into a cube, and curved the corner.

**Hannah Rosario**

1. draw an oval

2. to the inner left of the oval, draw a small black circle

3.on the outer right of the oval draw a triangle with one corner touching the oval

4. in the center of the oval draw a half circle with the opening facing left

5. on the top add a triangle with one flat side connected to the oval
