# DATA STRUCTURES: Images

We have already investigated a number of different **data structures**. Letâ€™s investigate the differences between images made from masses of silver nitrate crystals, printer toner, Jacquard looms, punchcards, and Python. 

## Analog Lab

Make images with self-assembling techniques: toner, metal filings, cyanotypes, solar prints.

## Instruction + Code Lab

Make images from a **rough matrix of LEDs**. Use Python to capture and control this matrix.
