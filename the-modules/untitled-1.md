# SELECTION: Find the Best Route

**Selection matters!** You will control your program with conditional statements: one or a number of statements is executed depending on the state of the program. In the second module we will demonstrate how to find the shortest path between two points.

## Analog Lab

Identify several points in the classroom, let’s call them “cities.” Make sure that you place some of these points on the floor, on tables, and chairs. Connect these points with string or rope, knotting the string and labeling each point that the strings cross. I will choose two cities: use the string to calculate the shortest path between them.

## Instruction

**Dijkstra’s algorithm and sorting weighted graphs.**

## Code Lab

Use selection to find the shortest path with Python. Measure the length of string \(the“edge”\) between each city\(“node”\)and record these entries in a **data structure**.
