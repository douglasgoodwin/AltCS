1. Introduce the concept of a catenary by showing students a chain held at two points.  The hands can be held closer together or further apart, but all these curves are catenaries.    
  
2. Ask students if they have seen this shape before.  Invite a discussion about catenaries seen in the world.  Show examples of images such as hanging power lines, clotheslines, jump ropes, hanging bridges, spider webs, etc.  
  
3. Students may suggest parabolas, the cables on suspension bridges, rainbows, or other similar looking curves.  Explain that catenaries are the special curve that results when the only force on the chain is the weight of the chain itself.  A parabola \(e.g., the arc of a thrown object\) is a slightly different curve.  The curve of a suspension bridge cable is also slightly different, because it supports the weight of the roadway, not just itself.  Rainbows are also different, because they are closer to circular arcs.  
  
4. With older students, you can point out that the equation of a parabola is y=x2, while the equation of a catenary is y=\(ex + e-x\)/2.  They can plot these on a graphing calculator and observe that they are very similar.

5. Ask students to visualize the shape of an inverted chain \(as if it was a chain of helium balloons rising away from gravity\).  Discuss examples of this shape in the world. Show images of various stone arches and of the St. Louis Arch.  Note that there are many types of arches, but relatively few are true catenaries with the shape of an inverted chain. \[Images above from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary).\]

6. Referring to the above diagrams \(which can be drawn on the board\) point out that in a chain, the force of gravity on each small segment results in a tension force which is aligned as a tangent to the chain.  \(The chain moves itself around until it finds an equilibrium with this property.\)  If we invert the diagram to the configuration of a catenary arch, the force of gravity on each small segment now results in a compression force which is aimed as a tangent to the curve.  Furthermore, if the blocks are cut so they meet at joints which are perpendicular to the curve, the compression force along the curve pushes the blocks so they hold together face-to-face.    
  
7. Historical connection: Before the mathematical properties of catenaries were fully understood, stone masons in medieval times knew this principle and designed arches by inverting the curves they measured from hanging chains.  Before computers, architects such as Antonio Gaudi used the upside-down chain method to calculate the arch shapes in cathedrals. \(See [link](http://dataphys.org/list/gaudis-hanging-chain-models/).\)  
  
8. With young students, let them play with a chain and get a feel for the catenary curve.  Ask them to hold the chain against a piece of paper on the wall, trace the curve, cut it out, and flip it to make an arch shape.  Their hands might be closer together or further apart, but they are all catenaries.
